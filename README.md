# Breast Cancer Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This repository contains a TensorFlow implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting breast cancer based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a CNN model that can effectively classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign based on features extracted from biopsies. The code includes data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (install using `pip install tensorflow`)
- Other dependencies specified in the script (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/delademf/breast-cancer-detection-cnn.git
    cd breast-cancer-detection-cnn
    ```



## Usage
- Open and run the Jupyter notebook or Python script in the root directory for step-by-step execution of data preprocessing, model building, and training.
- Adjust hyperparameters and configurations as needed.
- Ensure you have the necessary dataset, or replace the dataset loading section with your own dataset.

## Results
- The model is trained for a specified number of epochs with learning curves plotted for accuracy and loss.
- Evaluate the model on the test set to understand its performance.
- Provide insights into the model's effectiveness in breast cancer detection.
